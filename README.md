## Overview

This project implements the iSAX (Indexable Symbolic Aggregate Approximation) algorithm, as described in the original paper. The goal is to test and validate the effectiveness of iSAX for indexing and mining large-scale time series datasets.

## Features

- Time series normalization
- Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA)
- iSAX transformation and symbolic representation
- Replication of experimental results
